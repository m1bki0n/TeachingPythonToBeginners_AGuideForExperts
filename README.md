# How to Teach Python to Beginners: A Guide for Python Experts
This repository contains the slides for my 10-minute talk "How to Teach Python to Beginners: A Guide for Python Experts" at the first remote Python Pizza conference on 25 April 2020. 

In this README, I cite the resources I mentioned in the talk, plus additional resources that were brought up during the post-talk discussion

## Resources mentioned in the talk

:point_right: [*Learnable Programming*](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)

An essay by interface designer Bret Victor, in which he argues that many programming languages are "poorly-designed" and that we should change programming and "turn it into something that's understandable by people".

:point_right: [*Understanding How We Learn: A Visual Guide*](https://www.learningscientists.org/book) and [*The Learning Scientists*](https://www.learningscientists.org/) by [Dr. Yana Weinstein](https://www.yanaweinsteinjones.com/) and [Dr Megan Sumeracki](https://twitter.com/drsumeracki)

The evidence-based instructional strategies I presented were based mainly on the incredible work of these two amazing cognitive psychologists, who have made it their mission to make scientific research on learning more accessible. Their blog contains [free downloadable materials](https://www.learningscientists.org/downloadable-materials) six strategies for effective learning. I highly recommend them if you want to improve your teaching based on methods backed by research. 

:point_right: [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)

An online tool created by [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/) that visualizes the execution of each line of code. Excellent application of the [dual coding](https://www.learningscientists.org/dual-coding) strategy. [Here's a link](http://tiny.cc/e4mmnz) to the code I presented. Available in other programming languages.


:point_right: [PythonStdioGames](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames)

A collection of short text-based games written in Python 3. Curated by [Al Sweigart](https://alsweigart.com/) specifically for beginners. Show these games to your learners and help them develop an understanding of Python fundamentals using the [self-explanations](https://www.learningscientists.org/elaboration) strategy.

### Developing pedagogical content knowledge

:star: [The Carpentries Instuctor Training Guide](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)

This is perhaps the most comprehensive practical guide to teaching software and data skills I've ever seen that includes relevant theories from cognitive sciences. I think everyone who is mentoring in Python in any capacity to read this.

:sparkles: [*Teaching Python*](https://www.teachingpython.fm/)

A podcast all about teaching Python hosted by middle school teachers learning and teaching Python.  According to an attendee: "I find it very useful also as a way to get some feedback about existing tools".

I recommend their episode on ["Teaching Adult Learners"](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/teaching-python/episode-30-teaching-adult-learners/) featuring an interview with [Reuven Lerner](https://lerner.co.il/), another excellent Python trainer.

### Helpful Python resources of beginners

### Helpful tools for teaching Python 

:sparkles: [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

A tool that allows you to fully develop libraries directly on Jupyter notebooks. All your code, tests and documentation in one place, in the stlye of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

:sparkles: [Tutorials by Gael Varoquaux](https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux)

[Gael Varoquaux](gael-varoquaux.info) has written a few tutorials on `sci-kit learn`, `pandas`, machine learning etc using Jupyter notebooks, all available on his GitHub.
