# How to Teach Python to Beginners: A Guide for Python Experts
This repository contains the [slides](https://github.com/marielledado/TeachingPythonToBeginners_AGuideForExperts/blob/master/mdado_remotepythonpizza2020.pdf) for my 10-minute talk "How to Teach Python to Beginners: A Guide for Python Experts" at the first remote Python Pizza conference on 25 April 2020. 

In this README, I cite the resources I mentioned in the talk, plus additional resources that were brought up during the post-talk discussion

## Resources mentioned in the talk

#### :point_right: [*Learnable Programming*](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)

An essay by interface designer Bret Victor, in which he argues that many programming languages are "poorly-designed" and that we should change programming and "turn it into something that's understandable by people".

:speech_balloon: *"if someone is still not familiar with the work of Bret Victor, I totally recommend you to watch any video of him, it's really inspiring. I think one of the best videos he has is the one that develops a mario-alike video game."*

#### :point_right: [*Understanding How We Learn: A Visual Guide*](https://www.learningscientists.org/book) and [*The Learning Scientists*](https://www.learningscientists.org/) by [Dr. Yana Weinstein](https://www.yanaweinsteinjones.com/) and [Dr Megan Sumeracki](https://twitter.com/drsumeracki)

The evidence-based instructional strategies I presented were based mainly on the incredible work of these two amazing cognitive psychologists, who have made it their mission to make scientific research on learning more accessible. Their blog contains [free downloadable materials](https://www.learningscientists.org/downloadable-materials) six strategies for effective learning. I highly recommend them if you want to improve your teaching based on methods backed by research. 

#### :point_right: [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/)

An online tool created by [Philip Guo](http://pgbovine.net/) that visualizes the execution of each line of code. Excellent application of the [dual coding](https://www.learningscientists.org/dual-coding) strategy. [Here's a link](http://tiny.cc/e4mmnz) to the code I presented. Available in other programming languages.


#### :point_right: [PythonStdioGames](https://github.com/asweigart/PythonStdioGames)

A collection of short text-based games written in Python 3. Curated by [Al Sweigart](https://alsweigart.com/) specifically for beginners. Show these games to your learners and help them develop an understanding of Python fundamentals using the [self-explanations](https://www.learningscientists.org/elaboration) strategy.

## Additional resources 


### Applying dual coding and self-explanations

#### :star: [Art by Denise Yu](https://deniseyu.io/art/)

[Denise Yu](https://deniseyu.io/) is a software engineer who likes to create sketchnotes and doodles (with cats!) about technical subject matters. Doodling is a great exercise that applies both dual coding and self-explanation strategies that could help learners make sense of technical concepts.

#### :sparkles: [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com/)

Similar to Denise Yu, [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) creates adorable comics on programming topics.

:speech_balloon: *"...linux instead of python but also amazing visualizations!"*


#### :star: [Practice questions at the end of every *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* chapter](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart

You might have used this book to learn/teach Python, but have you ever paid attention to the practice questions at the end of every chapter? These serve as great self-explanation prompts.

### Developing pedagogical content knowledge

#### :star: [The Carpentries Instuctor Training Guide](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)

This is perhaps the most comprehensive practical guide to teaching software and data skills I've ever seen that includes relevant theories from cognitive sciences. I think everyone who is mentoring in Python in any capacity to read this.

#### :sparkles: [*Teaching Python*](https://www.teachingpython.fm/)

A podcast all about teaching Python hosted by middle school teachers learning and teaching Python. 
"I find it very useful also as a way to get some feedback about existing tools".

I recommend their episode on ["Teaching Adult Learners"](https://podtail.com/en/podcast/teaching-python/episode-30-teaching-adult-learners/) featuring an interview with [Reuven Lerner](https://lerner.co.il/), another excellent Python trainer.

### Helpful Python learning resources

#### :sparkles: [*Python Data Science Handbook*](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by Jake van der Plas

Excellent introductory book about Python for data science

:speech_balloon: *"the data science handbook is also quite nice, and should run on Binder"*

#### :star: [*A Whirlwind Tour of Python*](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/) by Jake van der Plas

A great intro to Python book geared towards people with prior programming experience in another language

#### :sparkles: [Tutorials by Gael Varoquaux](https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux)

[Gael Varoquaux](gael-varoquaux.info) has written a few tutorials on `sci-kit learn`, `pandas`, machine learning etc using Jupyter notebooks, all available on his GitHub.

:speech_balloon: *"I remember the jupyter notebooks from Gael Varoquaux as very useful to learn more alone at home."*

#### :sparkles: [nbdev](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev)

A tool that allows you to fully develop libraries directly on Jupyter notebooks. All your code, tests and documentation in one place, in the style of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

### Helpful tools for teaching Python online

#### :sparkles: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Lets you host and execute Python code Ã  la Jupyter notebooks, great for presenting tutorial/workshop content

:speech_balloon: *"[Learners] can save their own copy of the notebook and modify it.  Of course introducing git is great, but this is really a good option and I've seen it working nicely in meetups..."*

#### :sparkles: [Atom Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/)

Free and open source tool for collaborative (i.e., pair) programming

#### :sparkles: [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/)

Free and open source tool for recording and sharing terminal sessions 

:speech_balloon: *"just a terminal recorder, there are plenty of opensource alternatives, but it is a bit difficult to transform them to gif/video, not straighforward"*

#### :sparkles: Upload tutorial/workshop materials on GitHub

Host your teaching materials (i.e., as Jupyter notebooks) in a GitHub repo that learners can clone. Also a good opportunity to introduce Git.

:speech_balloon: *"you can put [Jupyter notebooks] on github and add an run on binder feature then"*

:speech_balloon: *"yeah, from my experience, introducing the git at the beginning of the course is really worth the effort"*

:speech_balloon: *"You can upload notebooks to github, if you've run it before comming github will render the result...It doesn't work on mobile but desktop should be fine"*
